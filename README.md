### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Srikanth Machiraju an Architect at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in), Published Author and Independent Researcher. I'm currently learning distributed machine learning and Artificial intelligence. I create a blend of my expertise in building cloud-native solutions with AI / ML to create innovative products. I also write articles on [linked-in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishsrik/) and [towards datascience](https://medium.com/@vishwanath.srikanth) related to building intelligent apps for cloud and ML. I'm specialized in Deep Reinforcement learning, so if you are looking for tips, quick help or have an interesting project you can always reach out to me.    

Here are some of the books I authored.

ðŸ“« How to reach me:
Write to vishwanath.srikanth@mail.com

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research work related to reinforcement learning.

âš¡ Fun fact:
I'm actually not as busy as it appears :)

**sriksmachi/sriksmachi** is a âœ¨ distributed ML systems âœ¨ repository where you can find all my work.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on applied RL
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning distributed ML systems
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on RL in the field of industrial automation
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ML/DS/AI, designing distributed systems for the cloud, microservices design
