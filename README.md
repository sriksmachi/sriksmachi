# Pioneering the Future of AI with Cutting-Edge Innovations and Thought Leadership

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Srikanth Machiraju an AI Architect at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in), Published Author and Independent Researcher. I'm currently learning to build innovative AI solutions, distributed machine learning and Artificial intelligence. I create a blend of my expertise in building cloud-native solutions with AI / ML to create innovative products. I also write articles on [linked-in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishsrik/) and [medium](https://techtalkwithsriks.medium.com/) related to building intelligent apps for cloud and ML. I'm specialized in Large language models, deep reinforcement learning, so if you are looking for tips, quick help or have an interesting project you can always reach out to me.    

Here are some of the books I authored.

Write to vishwanath.srikanth@mail.com / ping me on [linked-in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishsrik/)

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research work related to reinforcement learning.

âš¡ Fun fact:
I'm actually not as busy as it appears :)

**sriksmachi/sriksmachi** is a âœ¨ AI/ML âœ¨ repository where you can find all my work.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on applied RL
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning distributed ML systems
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on RL in the field of industrial automation
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ML/DS/AI, designing distributed systems for the cloud, microservices design
